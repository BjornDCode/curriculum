                    <h3>Rules on compulsory attendance</h3>
                    <p>There are no rules on compulsory attendance, but there are rules and criteria for study activity</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Credit transfers</h3>
                    <p>Successfully completed programme elements are equivalent to the corresponding programmeelements at other educational institutions offering the programme.</p>
                    <p>Students are obliged to provide information on completed programme elements from other Danish or foreign higher education programmes and on employment for which credit transfer may be granted. On a case-by-case basis, the educational institution approves credit transfers based on completed programme elements and employment comparable to subjects, programme components and internships. The decision is based on an academic and professional evaluation.</p>
                    <h4>Pre-approved credit transfer</h4>
                    <p>Students may apply for pre-approved credit transfer. In case of preliminary approval of a period of study in Denmark or abroad, the student is obliged, after completing the period of study, to document the programme elements completed during the approved period of study. Upon obtaining the preliminary approval, the student must consent to the institution requesting the necessary information after the student has completed the period of study.</p>
                    <p>In connection with pre-approved credit transfer, programme elements are deemed to have been completed if passed in accordance with the rules applicable to the programme.</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Criteria for assessment of study activity</h3>
                    <p>Students must actively participate in study activities, compulsory projects and assignments, tests and exams in accordance with the conditions described in this curriculum and in applicable acts and ministerial orders. KEA Copenhagen School of Design and Technology regularly evaluates student activity.</p>
                    <p>To be considered active, students must participate in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Project start-up meetings</li>
                        <li>Compulsory meetings with their supervisor/teacher</li>
                        <li>Project work, including submission of assignments on the learning platform for the Multimedia Design and Communication programme</li>
                        <li>Project presentations and evaluations</li>
                        <li>Tests and exams as described in this curriculum</li>
                        <li>A number of compulsory assignments each semester. These assignments must be approved for students to be able to register for exams in the semester in question.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Students who are unable to participate in study activities due to documented illness or for other acceptable reasons must contact the service centre for the Multimedia Design and Communication programme immediately. The service centre will inform the student about the necessary procedures, including the need to obtain a medical certificate. Students must pay for any medical certificates themselves.</p>
                    <p>Students who do not meet one or more of the above requirements will be invited to a meeting to discuss their insufficient study activity.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Disenrolment due to insufficient study activity</h3>
                    <p>Enrolment can be terminated for students who have not passed at least one exam within a consecutive period of at least one year.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Exemption rules</h3>
                    <p>KEA may, due to exceptional circumstances, grant exemptions from those rules in this curriculum that are solely laid down by KEA or in cooperation with the other educational institutions offering the programme.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Appeals</h3>
                    <p>Appeals against exams are treated in accordance with the rules set out in Part 10 of Ministerial Order no. 1519 of 16 December 2013 on Examinations on Professionally Oriented Higher Education Programmes (the Examination Order).</p>
                    <h4>When should an appeal be submitted?</h4>
                    <p>Appeals relating to exams and grading must be submitted within two weeks of the assessment (grade) being announced or published.</p>
                    <h4>How should an appeal be submitted?</h4>
                    <p>Appeals must be submitted to kvalitet@kea.dk individually and in writing, stating the reasons for the appeal. Appeals submitted jointly by two or more students may be rejected.</p>
                    <h4>What may appeals concern?</h4>
                    <p>You can submit an appeal concerning the basis for examination, the exam process or the assessment (grade).</p>
                    <h4>Who handles the appeal?</h4>
                    <p>Appeals are normally handled by KEA Quality Assurance. This does not, however, apply to appeals concerning the basis for examination if the exam is organised by the Danish Agency for Higher Education. In such cases, the appeal is forwarded to the agency together with KEAâ€™s opinion.</p>
